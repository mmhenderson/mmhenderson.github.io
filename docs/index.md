### About

I am a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Dr. Leila Wehbe](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/) and [Dr. Michael Tarr](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/tarrlab/) and funded by a Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowship from the [Carnegie Mellon Neuroscience Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ni/). My research combines techniques from neuroscience and machine learning, aiming to understand the computational basis of human visual cognition. I am particularly interested in the relationship between low-level visual representations and high-level semantic category representations in the brain, and how it reflects the correlational structure of the visual environment.

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Neurosciences with a Specialization in Computational Neurosciences from the University of California, San Diego, working with [Dr. John Serences](https://serenceslab.ucsd.edu/). During my PhD I used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) along with computational modeling to investigate how adaptive neural codes support cognitive abilities like short-term memory and object recognition. I also used neural network models to explore how natural image statistics contribute to biases in visual feature representations.
