### About

I am a postdoc at the [Carnegie Mellon Neuroscience Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ni/) working with [Dr. Leila Wehbe](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lwehbe/) and [Dr. Michael Tarr](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/tarrlab/). My research combines techniques from neuroscience and machine learning, aiming to understand the computational basis of human cognition. Presently, I am working on understanding how low- and mid-level visual features contribute to neural processing and perception of high-level categories.

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Neurosciences with a Specialization in Computational Neurosciences from the University of California, San Diego, working with [Dr. John Serences](https://serenceslab.ucsd.edu/). During my PhD I used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) along with computational modeling to measure how visual representations in the human brain are modified by task context. I also used neural network models to explore the computational constraints that influence visual system organization and function.
