### About

I am a postdoc at the Carnegie Mellon Neuroscience Institute working with Dr. Leila Wehbe and Dr. Michael Tarr. My research combines techniques from neuroscience and machine learning, aiming to understand the computational basis of human cognition.

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Neurosciences with a Specialization in Computational Neurosciences from the University of California, San Diego, working with Dr. John Serences. There I used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) along with computational modeling to measure how visual representations in the human brain are modified by task context. I also used neural network models to explore the computational constraints that influence visual system organization and function.
